## Experience:

- ### Engineering Lead, PrivateCircle (2017 - Present)
  #### As a Tech Lead:
  - 4 years of experience leading backend and data engineering teams at PrivateCircle.
  - 2 years of experience managing DevOps team while collaborating with development teams to streamline development and deployment processes.
  - Directing team expansion and training initiatives, significantly contributing to the development of a robust engineering culture.
  - Developing and implementing engineering strategies and policies.
  - Project planning and regular maintenance schedules.
  
  #### Independent Contributor Experience:
  - As a discovery platform, full search text is one of the core components of the PrivateCircle platform. Introduced and implemented full text search over ElasticSearch, integrated it with all our data pipelines and wrote a custom DSL layer to be used over MongoDB and Postgres(our 2 primary DB's) saving time and development efforts. Components included Mapping, Indexing, Querying and Re-indexing layers. This change increased the breadth of search to all data points in our system, increased search accuracy and speed by 10x.
  - Standardization of microservices development, introducing cookiecutter templates to streamline codebase generation and infrastructure setup (using extensively configurable templates that generate repositories, CI/CD and other infrastructure components). This reduced the start-up effort of a project from a week to under a few hours.
  - CDC implementation over MongoDB and Postgres clusters in an effort to move from batch ETL to a streaming event-driven architecture, significantly optimizing data pipelines and reducing operational costs. This helped PrivateCircle create a new product that lets users consume streams of data changes via Feeds, Signals and Newsletters. 
  - Implemented central logging for all applications, significantly improving monitoring and troubleshooting capabilities. Integrated new-relic for instrumentation and alerting. 
  - Automated Ansible deployments of self-managed Elasticsearch, MongoDB, and RabbitMQ clusters, enhancing system reliability and efficiency.
  - Transformed architecture/infrastructure from a monolith to a distributed monolith to support increased customer demand during COVID-19.
  - Created a fuzzy matching algorithm along with an internal tool for mapping data from various data sources to our platformâ€™s entities. Improved the algorithm using machine learning and an ensemble of fuzzy algorithms that later grew to become an entity mastering project, which is one of the core modules today.
  - Regular maintenance and performance tuning of all applications, self-managed data-stores and environment upgrades including Python, OS, package/system dependencies.


- ### Associate Data Scientist, Celebal Tech (2016 - 2017)
  - Developed a natural language query interface (primarily English) over SQL databases using various NLP techniques.
  - Master Data Management Platform for Healthcare and Life Sciences organizations, including tools for data validations, mastering rule application, and data stewardship mechanisms.
  - Number Plate Detection System using CNN on real-time video streaming data using Caffe and TensorRT.
